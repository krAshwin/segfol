# segfol
Automation using Python : The script is primarily a segregator, that is used to segregate similar file types into folders.

## Getting Started
Clone the repository, navigate to the folder where the repository has been cloned and run the following command in the terminal,

```shell
python3 segfol /path/of/the/directory/
```
`/path/to/the/directory/` is the directory location, that needs to be uncluttered.

## Requirements
`python3` must be installed in your system.

## Contribute
Database dictionary used - `extension.py` is not complete and not all file types and folders are specified. It will be more accurate, if more data is added.
